        <h1>Success Stories</h1>
        <p>
            Sudharani, hailing from Kothapalli village in Anantapur district, shares the aspirations 
            common among youth of her age, securing a good job and ensuring a better future for herself and her parents. 
            However, her family’s financial stability relied entirely on rain-fed agricultural yields. With Anantapur
             being a rain shadow region* with 18 droughts in the past 20 years, affording higher education was
              challenging for her family. Just as she was on the verge of dropping out to assist her family in 
              farming and provide financial support, she learned about the Special Education Programme offered 
              by RDT.</p></br>

<p>The Special Education Programme in RDT was initiated in 2004 to create accessible education for meritorious 
    students who achieve the highest marks and wish to pursue higher education. These students are provided with 
    scholarships to assist them in their endeavours. The programme has enabled 5,287 students to reach their goals 
    and fulfil their dreams, with 339 students qualifying for IITs, NITs, and many premier institutions.</p></br>

<p>Having excelled in her SSC examinations with high marks, Sudharani was selected for the Special Education Programme.
     “It was the happiest day for me and my parents, knowing I would have the chance to study at top universities,” says Sudharani.
      Qualifying with good grades in the MPC stream for her intermediate studies, she initially faced challenges due to transitioning
       from a Telugu Medium High school to an English Medium College. “Understanding everything in English took some time, but I used to practise 
       every day by reading books and talking with my friends,” recalls Sudharani.</p></br>

        <p>Enrolling in NBKRIST College, Nellore, Sudharani, pursued the CSE stream in engineering. Within a
             year of graduating, she also qualified as a lecturer at a Government Polytechnic College in Simhadripuram. 
             “That day remains the happiest of my life,” reflects Sudharani. Currently, she works at the Government Polytechnic College,
              Anantapur. For her, quality education holds the utmost importance. “With dedication, determination, and motivation, 
              one can achieve whatever they aim for,” says Sudharani, who now imparts knowledge to hundred of children, also emphasises
               on the transformative power of education.</p></br>

          <p>Sudharani believes that education is a tool for women to create a gender-equal society.
            “For me, it’s not merely about securing a job; it’s about the knowledge gained through education 
            for everyday living,” she states. Sudharani derives immense joy and pride from witnessing her students
             achieve great heights. “Teaching is not just about imparting knowledge; it’s about supporting students to be
              change-makers,” she adds with a smile.</p></br>

        <p>Sudharani fulfilled her aspirations of securing a stable job and providing a better life for her family.
             She now aims to complete her PhD and become a professor at a university. Sudharani is one of many who have
             achieved their goals through hard work and determination with the support of RDT’s Special Education Programme.</p></br>
